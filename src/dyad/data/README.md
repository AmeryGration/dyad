# Package data

The probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions for the period and log-period random variables defined by Moe and Stefano (2017) do not have closed-form expression (see dyad.stats.period.moe2017 and dyad.stats.log_period.moe2017). Dyad evaluates these functions by interpolating between values pre-computed on a regular lattice of arguments. This directory contains those pre-computed values and the code used to generate them.
