Dyad
####

Dyad is a two-body dynamics and binary-star statistics package for astrophysicists.

It provides:

1. a class object, `dyad.Orbit`, that represents the bound orbit of a body in a gravitational central potential,
2. a class object, `dyad.TwoBody`, that represents the component orbits of a bound gravitational two-body system,
3. a suite of probability distributions, `dyad.stats`, for the orbital properties of a population of binary stars, and
4. a suite of utility functions for computing derived properties.
