Dyad is a two-body dynamics and binary-star statistics package for astrophysicists.

It provides:

#. a class object, :class:`dyad.Orbit`, that represents the bound orbit of a body in a gravitational central potential,

#. a class object, :class:`dyad.TwoBody`, that represents the component orbits of a bound gravitational two-body system,

#. a suite of probability distributions, :mod:`dyad.stats`, for the orbital properties of a population of binary stars, and

#. a suite of utility functions for computing derived properties.
